Given a circle represented as (radius, x_center, y_center) and an axis-aligned rectangle represented as (x1, y1, x2, y2), where (x1, y1) are the coordinates of the 
bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the top-right corner of the rectangle.
Return yes if the circle and rectangle are overlapped otherwise return no.
In other words, check if there are any point (xi, yi) such that belongs to the circle and the rectangle at the same time.
For example,
radius, x_center, y_center, x1, y1, x2, y2=1 0 0 1 -1 3 1, resp..,
